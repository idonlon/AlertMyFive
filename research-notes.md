# Notes from NDLS
* interviewed more than 2,600 workers
* We estimate there to be about 120,000 workers either seeking or performing day-labor assignments
* predominantly Latino
* most work residential construction and remodeling jobs
* Contractors hire them for a variety of reasons
* The largest concentration of day laborers is in the West (42%), followed by the East (23%), the Southwest (18%), the South (12%), and the Midwest (4%).
* Almost half reported at least one instance of wage theft
* 44% were denied food or water breaks
* Merchants and police often target day laborers while they seek work
* Worker centers have emerged as the most comprehensive response to the workplace abuses that day laborers endure

# Problems
* wage theft
* unsafe working conditions
* insufficient breaks/illegal hours
* work injuries
* getting medical care

# Things that work
* organizing and educational campaigns for workers on street corners
* organizing around detention centers
* leadership development through popular education
* providing services, including legal, that promote and defend immigrant workers’ labor and civil rights
* worker centers
  * they are full-service community organizations that operate a hiring hall, coordinate workers’ rights activities (filing wage claims, OSHA training), provide services (ESL courses, civic leadership), and sponsor community events (litter cleanup days, soccer tournaments, open houses)
