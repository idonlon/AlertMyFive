Next steps:
UX
* Give the option for user to set their trigger, i.e. so they can text 'POTATO' and we will begin the timer.

Database
* To save phone numbers to a file.
* To associate unique ID with those numbers.
* To store the user's custom message and to send that out when a user doesn't respond after 10 minutes after texting us.

Logic
* To recognize when someone sends us their unique ID as a signal of feeling unsafe.
* To recognize when a unique ID is texted with commands such as -DELETE or -EDITM.
* To incorporate a timer of 10 minutes and to then set up the logic to send the message to the emergency contacts.
    - Receive unique ID or unique alert message, begin timer, after 10 minutes send a messae "Are you OK", if no reply
      after 1 minute, then send custom or generic message to user's emergency contacts.
